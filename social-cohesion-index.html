        The Social Cohesion Index (SCI) is the Citizen Research Centre’s main contribution to public discourse around the level of fracture in our societies. 
The Social Cohesion Index is built using social media data – Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and blogs – and measures levels of cohesion / friction online in multiple countries.</P>
<P>This work draws on the understanding that verbal expressions of violence often precede physical violence. Also, social media interaction has led to citizens expressing views on public platforms that previously would have been confined to the home or circles of friends. As a result, we are able to monitor and measure expressions of prejudice in a way never before possible.
We use targeted search terms and monitors trained on thousands of relevant pieces of social media data. These then analyse millions of pieces of social media data and identify precisely the percentage of social media conversation in a country that is discriminatory/pejorative.

      <p>The Social Cohesion Index is a work in progress, and aims to:</p>
      <ul><li>Index five African countries that are active in English on social media (South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana). We chose these because English is easier for us to analyse, and because the volumes in these countries make for greater accuracy.</li>
        <li>Establish a comprehensive basket, which expresses the amount of social media activity that is discriminatory as a percentage of total social media activity in each country</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="padding-left: 60px;">
        <ul>
<li>We then unpack this basket - dividing the discriminatory language into sub-sets such as racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious intolerance and ‘tribalism’</li>
<li>Each of these is then expressed in Index format across the five countries</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>The relative Index is expressed as the percentage from which a given country deviated from the norm across all five countries - on a total (all discriminatory language) and a specific (sexism, racism etc) level</li> 
  <li>Once all this work is done, we can establish Total Indices as well as Specific Indices that evaluate all five countries against each other
We will then expand this to include Europe and other continents.</li></p>

<p>The Social Cohesion Index is pending – if you are interested in receiving updates on our progress or wish to fund the acceleration of this work, please contact us here.</p>
