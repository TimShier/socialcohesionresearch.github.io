        The Social Cohesion Index: We like this project so much we named our company after it! 
The Social Cohesion Index (SCI) is built using data found on Twitter. This tool measures the levels of cohesion / friction online. We can compare data on one particular topic, (such as the pejorative terms used to describe refugees) or within a geographical region (looking at relevant comments within a country). 
This work draws on the understanding that verbal expressions of violence often precede physical violence, and that our inter-connected online forms of communication allow for conversations to occur that were previously not possible. For an in-depth reading of our ideological leaning and the thinking behind the Social Cohesion Index, read here.</p>

The Social Cohesion Index is a work in progress.  It aims to:
<ul><li>Use our Twitter Activity Index to identify the five most active countries on social media in Africa</li>
<li>Examine pejorative conversation in those five countries, with an aim to:</li>
<li><ul><li>Explore the level of growth of racist, sexist, homophobic and other intolerant language in each of those countries over time.</li></ul></li>
<li>This will be expressed as a total index, and then broken down by topic in each country</li>
Again, depending on interest in our work, we will expand this to Europe, and potentially globally basis.</p><p>

<div class='medium-6 large-6 columns'>
A variety of related and episodic work will spring from the Social Cohesion Index:
<ul>
<li>Deep dives on language used, either by country or by topic</li>
<li>The change in tone of language over time</li>
<li>The different forms of prejudice that exist in a region, country or on a particular topic – ranging from racism to religious intolerance</li>
<li>Episodic reports on the rise of intolerance in countries of interest (Donald Trumps’ campaign springs to mind…)</li>
<li>The reaction of citizens on social media to incidences of social fracture – how do people in individual countries react to Boko Haram vs Al Shabaab vs ISIS attacks? Or how do Europeans speak about refugees as they arrive? </li>
</ul>        </p></div>
