        Opinion is our online analytics tool, developed through our partnership with Crimson Hexagon. Crimson Hexagon is arguably the best social media analytics tool in the world.</p><p> 
 Typically used for branding and market research work, Crimson Hexagon enables its users to analyse all publically available social media data. Using algorithms and adaptive learning, Crimson Hexagon can process billions of tweets, Facebook or Tumblr posts. It sorts and makes sense of massive data sets. In the market research and branding space Crimson Hexagon is seen as the best analytics tool available.</p><p> 
It has also stored the entire world’s conversation about everything on social media from 2008 – almost 1 trillion pieces of social media data. This allows us to run retrospective longitudinal studies stretching as far back as 2008 – invaluable in the world of social research.</p><p>
At Social Cohesion Research, we have applied the power of Crimson Hexagon to our social research work. We use it to make sense of online-conversations about issues that matter. Using Crimson Hexagon we have been able to conduct fascinating research on issues such as radical Islam and refugees. You are welcome to look at what we have done so far, here.</p><p>
Opinion is the tool we use to deliver our Twitter Activity Index and (in time) our Social Cohesion Index.

       The amazing thing about social media data is that it is simultaneously quantitative and qualitative.  Analyse data at the macro level and you are looking at millions, even hundreds of millions of pieces of data.  Here we are looking at what people are saying about an issue, or how they are feeling about a topic.  So what does the local, regional and global social media conversation around ebola, the insurgency in Mali, the refugee crisis in Europe or diabetes look like? What are the conversation points, the trends?  And how has this changed over time (retrospective analysis).</p><p>  
Drill down though, and eventually the analysis becomes qualitative – what did individual people say, about specific topics.</p><p> 
Our platform can answer almost any question, if framed as follows:
<i>What do people who are active on social media in any given country (also region or globally) feel/ think about any particular topic of interest.</i>
Some of our clients have raised concerns about privacy – we assure you that all the information analysed on Crimson Hexagon by Social Cohesion Research is information that has been placed in the public domain. All twitter posts are intended for public consumption, and only open posts from other social media channels (like Facebook and Instagram) are available for analysis.</p><p>  
Being the only company in the world currently using Crimson Hexagon this way, we are pretty excited about what we do and how we do it!

      <h3>Reach</h3>

	<div class='medium-6 large-6 columns'>
      <p>
        Reach is a face-to-face interviewing solution that is provided to us by our parent company - Vibrand Research.</p><p>
Through our partnerships with the best independent research agencies across the regions (West, East, Southern, Central and North Africa and the Middle East), Reach is available in 54 countries across Africa and the Middle East (click here for the list). Reach is an agile, adaptive research solution that utilises technology and partnerships to deliver face-to face Citizen Surveys in numerous locations.  It is centrally managed, with field teams that number in the thousands.  We run short (7-10 minutes) interviews with citizens in the streets of hundreds of cities and towns. In some countries (like Nigeria) we can access as many as 50 cities and towns.  In other countries, access is limited to main centres.</p><p>
From studies run in individual cities to those run simultaneously across multiple countries; Reach allows access to information from citizens quickly, effectively and accurately.</p>

      <p>
Reach provides all of the benefit of in-person interviews without the cost or complexity, combining the skill and nuance of a face-to-face interview with the innovation of a state-of-the-art online research platform. This provides us with an agile, cost-effective and quick research offering with a level of depth and breadth that continues to amaze us!</p><p>
Our 54 countries include some of the hardest-to-get-to, most dangerous places on earth (click here for the list). Interviews in danger zones - such as South Sudan or Syria - do come with increased cost and complexity, but we can we can run interviews anywhere from Damascus to Timbuktu.</p><p> 
Reach Field and Reporting:
Our data collection and analytics are of the highest standard, and we have a variety of measures built into our process and our platform that assist in identifying outliers and potential risks.

These also include project specific variables like household income, employment status, religion or ethnicity. The dashboard includes an automatic statistical significance indicator.</li>
<li>A presentation: here we provide total level reporting, as well as reporting on all matters of statistical significance.</li>  
<li>Regression analysis on all data (if required)</li>
