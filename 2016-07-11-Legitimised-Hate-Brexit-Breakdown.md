<p>In the wake of the Brexit vote, mainstream media has been reporting on the rise in hate crimes committed across the UK.</p>

<p>According to the National Police Chiefs Council, hate crimes reported to them rose with 57% between Thursday 23rd and Sunday 26th, compared to the corresponding days four weeks prior. The police online hate-crime reporting site, True Vision, tells an ever starker tale, stating the reports to the site have increased by 500% between the 23rd and the 30th of June when compared with a weekly average for 2016.</p>

<p>While traditional sources can provide statistics regarding the rate of reported incidents, this can only give us a partial picture. Many incidents are not reported for a variety of reasons, from the victim not realising that a crime has indeed occurred to a mistrust in the efficacy of the police. These reports also do not tell us anything about the sentiment of the general public on the issue.</p>

<p>Our social media analysis looked at almost 5 and a half million posts, tweets, blogs and forum entries from the UK, dating back to the 1st of January 2016, all relating to xenophobia, racism and prejudice against  either immigrants or minority groups. This in-depth look at what Britons are actually saying and sharing paints a much richer picture of how the UK is reacting to the issue of rising post (and pre!) referendum displays of hate and intolerance.</p>

<h3>RISE IN PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF INTOLERANCE</h3>
<p>Personal accounts of post-referendum racism have flooded social media and, by extension, mainstream media with European citizens in England as well as non-white Britons falling victim to emboldened bigoted </p>

<h3>Crypto Currency Centric Conversation Topic Waves</h3>
<p>Crypto Currency conversation by contrast was quite upbeat – with crypto currencies touted as an increasingly attractive option following the Brexit referendum.  Most of the conversation concerned the spike in the Bitcoin prices, with minor themes being the growth of Bitcoin in popularity after the referendum.</p><p>
While this has since corrected, immediately following the vote, the Pound dropped as much as 9%, and the value of Bitcoin climbed by 8%.

<div class='spacing'></div>
<h3>Topics of Conversation</h3>
<p>This trend continued in the topic wheels of the conversations. The Pound conversation was largely doom and gloom…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" ><img src="images/blog-images/pound_wheel.PNG"></p>
<p>While the Crypto Currency conversation was more hopeful:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" ><img src="images/blog-images/crypto_wheel.PNG"></p>
<div class='spacing'></div>
<h3>Affinities</h3>
<p>A powerful tool in Crimson Hexagon’s social media analysis box is affinities analysis. Here we were able to match the interests of the people contributing to the Pound conversation against the rest of twitter, so the same for the members of the Crypto Currency conversation and then look at the variances of each against each other.</p><p>
Those contributing to the Pound conversation tended to be more ‘establishment’ – interested in stock markets, forex, David Cameron and finance.</p><p>
Those contributing to the Crypto Currency conversation were demonstrably more forward thinking – and tended to be interested in Noam Chomsky, P2P (sharing services), Bitcoin and Reddit. 
</p>
<h3>Implications</h3>
<p>As established currencies wax and wane, hedges emerge… Traditionally gold has been the hedge in turbulent times –now crypto currencies also play a role.</p><p>
While this piece has focused on the pound, emerging market currencies and economies usually bear the brunt of political uncertainty and social upheaval. Strong, coherent policies that are supported by citizens are the hallmark of a stable democracy. Brexit has shown us that even the most developed economies hide fractured societies, with disparate ambitions and goals for their future. Fear hides in the wings, and politicians need to beware of reducing complex decisions to binary options in referenda.
