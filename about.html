        Research Centre is an organisation dedicated to investigating the various elements that make up social cohesion. 
We take a broad view of social cohesion, and our research encompasses all socially oriented work to do with human relations. This ranges from expressions of social discontent, to racism, sexism, xenophobia, extremism, conflict, terrorism, displacement, the breakdown of social cohesion in political processes and so on.
We operate globally through our social media monitoring platform, Crimson Hexagon.  We also have face to face capabilities (both qualitative and quantitative) all over Africa, and in some European and Middle Eastern countries. For more on the research methods we offer, please see Research Products.

        Our primary self-developed product is our Social Cohesion Index (see social cohesion index), in which we analyse social media to produce an index that ranks various countries on their level of social cohesion.
We are a sister company to, and are largely funded by Vibrand Research (www.vibrand.co.za), a South African based research company.
We run ad hoc projects for our clients, delving deeply into social cohesion in all its multi-faceted nuance, but we also actively seek funding to keep producing reports that are of interest to decision makers and policy makers across the world. If you would like to fund a project, or delve deeper into any countries level of social cohesion, please drop us a mail.
