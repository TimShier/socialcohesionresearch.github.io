<ul>
<li>Utilise our network of research partners in Africa and the Middle East</li>

<li>Partner with specialist consultants with relevant knowledge</li>
<li>Make use of our years of research experience</li>

       We aim to use research and knowledge creation for social good. We provide primary data to organisations or individuals who may need it. Our clients include NGOs, Think Tanks, Development Agencies and Foreign Aid Organisations. 
We develop and produce primary research. We have found that our knowledge of how to ask great questions has enabled us to conduct great research on just about anything.</p><p> We do have specialist skillsets and areas of expertise. For those that we don’t, we draw on our extensive network of subject matter experts Thus far we have conducted on issues related to health, safety, crime, violence, terrorism, extremism, refugees, migration, disease and education…. 
We are committed to an ongoing process of delivering usable research in the public interest. These are available here (link to publicly available reports).
