      <p>Data has become a critical part of journalism in the 21st century. Readers are looking for an increasingly current, insightful and meaningful analysis of the world around them to help normalise, explain, expand and enrich their world. Concurrently, media business models are shifting and, while the industry is in transition, journalists are being asked to perform miracles to meet this growing consumer demand. Fewer hands to help, more demanding readers to appease. A difficult juggling act and the pressure really falls on the individuals.</p>
 
<p>That's where we come in. We work with Crimson Hexagon (link) to conduct detailed Social Media led research into a broad range of social issues. We have several articles below which you are welcome to draw on for publishing, with the following provisos:</p>
<ul><li>We are given forewarning of where and when publication is to occur</li>
<li>If there is a digital link that can be provided, please do.  We will send these out as Facebook posts on our Facebook page, generating publicity for ourselves and your organisation.</li>
<li>The Citizen Research Centre and Crimson Hexagon are to be credited in all articles, with links to our websites</li>
</ul>
