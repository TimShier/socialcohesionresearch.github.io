      <p>Welcome to the media page of the Citizen Research Centre!  This is for journalists only, and we have asked you here to assist us in establishing media partnership with news outlets around the world.  Browse our site, but in short we produce media-worthy research for publication.  We use Crimson Hexagon, the world’s premier social media analytics platform to delve into issues of social interest.
We are looking to set up partnerships with media outlets, and will be producing research that is newsworthy on global issues on an ongoing basis.  All our content is free to publish, <strong>with the following provisos:</strong>
<ul><li>We are given forewarning of where and when publication is to occur</li>
<li>If there is a digital link that can be provided, please do.  We will send these out as Facebook posts on our Facebook page, generating publicity for ourselves and your organisation.</li>
<li>The Citizen Research Centre is to be credited in all articles</li>
<li>A link to our website (www.citizenresearchcentre.org ) is to be published at the end of each article.</li>
<li>Once a relationship is established we would like to link to your website on our website.</li></ul></p>
